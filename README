This toolset for literate programming is actually intermediate stuff was made
during adoptation CWEB for Go language http://golang.org.
Almost all original algorithms are saved, except high-bit processing and some
other C-specific ones.
CWEB-in-Go works only with UTF-8 encoded input files and produces UTF-8 encoded 
output files.

This directory contains the following files:
